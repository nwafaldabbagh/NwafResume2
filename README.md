# UCF Resume Website (GitHub Pages)

This repo contains a multi‑page resume website that meets your assignment requirements:

- Deployed on **username.github.io** (replace with your GitHub username).
- Main resume page with name, UCF email, LinkedIn link, professional photo, objective, education, experience, projects, skills, and awards.
- Two dedicated **Project** pages with title, image, description, and skills learned.
- Uses **semantic HTML** (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `footer`) and minimizes non‑semantic elements.
- **Responsive** design with mobile‑first CSS and **accessibility** features (skip link, landmarks, alt text, focus styles, color contrast).

## How to Use

1. **Download** this zip and extract it.
2. Rename the folder to something simple like `resume-site`.
3. Replace the placeholder images in `/assets`:
   - `headshot.png`: add your professional photo (keep the filename).
   - `project1.png`, `project2.png`: add screenshots/diagrams of your projects.
4. Open `index.html`, `project1.html`, and `project2.html` and edit content (email, LinkedIn, text, etc.).

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Create a GitHub account if needed.
2. Create a new public repository named **`YOUR-USERNAME.github.io`** (exact match).
3. Upload the files (or clone + push).
4. Visit `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io` to view your site (first publish can take a minute).

### Optional: Work Locally with Live Preview

You can simply double‑click `index.html` to preview, or run a lightweight server:

```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

- [x] Semantic landmarks (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `footer`)
- [x] Sufficient color contrast and focus outlines
